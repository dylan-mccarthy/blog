Welcome to my new blog site! I've been working on transitioning my blog and a bit of branding to Dylan DevEx from DMC As a Service since last year and have finally gotten around to getting this site up and running.

As some might have noticed I've been pretty quiet over the last few months, a few things outside of work have been keeping me away, but I am back and ready to start sharing some new content.

So what does 2025 have in store for us?

## Speaking Engagements

Well to start with I've got a few speaking engagements already lined up, focusing mainly on Platform Engineering and DevEx:

- [NDC Melbourne](https://ndcmelbourne.com/) - March 2025
    I'll be speaking about Platform Engineering vs DevOps.

- [DevOpsCon San Diego](https://devopscon.io/san-diego/) - May 2025
    I'll be again speaking about Platform Engineering vs DevOps but also I'll be giving a talk on Developer Experience.

I also have a few others in the works but I'll share more about those as they get confirmed.

## Streaming

I'll be back to streaming soon, I've been on a bit of a break lately as i've been having some issues with just getting the timing down to do it.

To accomedate more streams the plan at the moment is to stream more regularly but it might not always be on the same day or time, so the goal will be to stream a lot of my side projects which includes my home lab, video game coding, AI experiments and more.

Follow me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dylandevex) or [YoutTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaPH9VCdKkcziQJW8of-PqA) to get notified when I go live.

## Blogging

So make up for the lack of structed DevOps/Platform Engineering/DevEx content on the streams I'll be trying to focus more on getting blogs out on those topics.

I'll be aiming for at least 1 blog post a month, and be working on covering topics with some good depth and detail.

Starting off I'll be re-uploading some of my older blog posts from DMC As a Service, to provie some basic information but then I'll get deeper into Platform Engineering with a series on how to build your own Internal Developer Platform, so look out for that one.

## Community

Last year I started up the Melbourne GitHub User Group, and I'll be continuing that this year, getting a few things organised and also looking for speakers to help kick off the year, so if you're in Melbourne and want to speak at a meetup, let me know.

I'm also on the hunt for some sponsors for the group, so if you're interested in sponsoring the group, let me know as well!

## Conclusion

So that's a bit of an update on what's happening in 2025, I'm looking forward to getting back into the swing of things and sharing some new content with you all.
