        Hi, I’m Dylan McCarthy – known professionally as Dylan DevEx. I’m a Principal Engineer at Versent, a Microsoft MVP, and a passionate speaker on Platform Engineering and Developer Experience (DevEx). My work centers on delivering innovative implementations in DevOps, Platform Engineering, and above all, Developer Experience.

        With over a decade of experience in the Microsoft ecosystem, I’ve built my career on transforming complex technical challenges into streamlined, user-focused solutions. I leverage my expertise in the Microsoft stack to empower teams and organizations, ensuring that their engineering practices are not only efficient but also highly engaging for developers.

        At Versent, I help drive projects that integrate robust DevOps methodologies with cutting-edge Platform Engineering strategies, all while prioritizing the Developer Experience. I believe that when developers enjoy using the tools and platforms provided to them, they create better, more innovative products.

        In addition to my hands-on work, I regularly speak about Platform Engineering and Developer Experience at industry events, sharing insights and best practices with the broader tech community. This blog is my platform to discuss emerging trends, share practical advice, and explore how to make engineering more enjoyable and productive.
